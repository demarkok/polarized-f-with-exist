    *** Type Inference Algorithm
        Local Type Inference Algorithm for impredicative SystemF with existential types
        - No ∃pack/∀inst anywhere but λ and some let-bindings are annotated 
        - Algorithm is fundamentally novel
            - ∃ brakes the standard invariants that justify using unification
            - Mix UNIF and ANTIUNIF
            - Full correctness proof
            - Exploits CBPV to control 
                quantifiers/arities
        - Subtyping permits
    *** Type Inference Framework
        We discuss the design alternatives
        that allow us to apply the same 
        general scheme of the algorithm 
        to different type systems.
