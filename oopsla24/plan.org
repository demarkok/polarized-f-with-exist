* Abstract
* Introduction
** What is the problem?
    - System F is the basis for the types in many languages.
    - The type inference for Impredicative System F is undecidable:
      Examples instantiating ∀-s.
    - Existential Types are useful, but the type inference for ∃ is under-researched.
** What Good in Solving it?
    - Fundamental duality in logic: forall vs exists 
    - Useful for data abstraction, modules/components, coinductive type encodings, etc
    - Reveals new ways of understanding type inference: usual algorithms for forall rely
      on relationship between specialisation and unification which break in the presence
      of exists
      
** Contributions
    *** Type Inference Algorithm
        Local Type Inference Algorithm for impredicative SystemF with existential types
        - No ∃pack/∀inst anywhere but λ and some let-bindings are annotated 
        - Algorithm is fundamentally novel
            - ∃ brakes the standard invariants that justify using unification
            - Mix UNIF and ANTIUNIF
            - Full correctness proof
            - Exploits CBPV to control 
                quantifiers/arities
        - Subtyping permits
    *** Type Inference Framework
        We discuss the design alternatives
        that allow us to apply the same 
        general scheme of the algorithm 
        to different type systems. 
        - Our work gives a deeper understanding on the inference for impredicative ∃
        - The algorithm as it presented here, cannot be used in practice without modifications.
* Overview
    ** Informal Explanation of our approach
        - subtyping is the driver of the inference: examples

    ** Introduce the language
        - ±-stratification of the language
        - Language of Types
        - Language of Terms
    ** Examples, Key Ideas
        - System = Declarative + Algorithmic Counterparts 
        *** Types
            - Non-trivial equivalence
            - Type normalization 
            - Algorithmic Variables => Constraints
            - Merging constraints requires Unification.
            - Merging constraints require Least Upper Bound, 
                which is is non-trivial: Anti-Unification
        *** Terms
            - Interface to Subtyping: Annotations, Type applications. 
            - Inference in let bindings: uniqueness
* Declarative System
    ** Definition of the declarative system
        - Explain ∀/∃ Rules
        - Explain substitution specification notation 
        - Explain ↑/↓ Rules
    ** Properties
        - Variables do not have proper subtypes and supertypes
        - Free Variable propagation: N ≤ M => FV(N) ⊆ FV(M)
        - Subtyping is Reflexive and Transitive, and is preserved by substitution
        - Characterization of equivalence: variable ordering is sufficient 
        - Characterization of Supertypes
